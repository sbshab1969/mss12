To access the Oracle Maven Repository, you must use Maven 3.0.4 or later and make a few modifications to your Maven settings and project POM, 
as described in Section 6.3, Section 6.4, and Section 6.5.

Note that due to changes made in Maven 3.1, some Maven plugins developed for Maven 3.0.n may not work properly with Maven 3.1.n (or later). 
Oracle recommends that you use the version of Maven recommended by your particular Oracle Fusion Middleware release.
