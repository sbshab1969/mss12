Pre-defined Descriptor Files

There are four predefined descriptor formats available for reuse, packaged within the Assembly Plugin. 
Their descriptorIds are:

    bin
    jar-with-dependencies
    src
    project

An uber-JAR—also known as a fat JAR or JAR with dependencies—is a JAR file that contains not only a Java program, 
but embeds its dependencies as well. 
We recommend against using uber-JARs. They introduce many problems for downstream consumers.
